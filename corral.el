;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds commands that allow the user to quickly and intuitively
;; wrap a desired amount of text within delimiters, including parentheses and
;; quotes.  After calling one of the interactive commands, repeated calls will
;; shift the corral instead of inserting new delimiters, expanding the amount
;; of text contained within the delimiters.
